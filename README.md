A CLI Expense tracking npm package

## Todo:

- [ ] Allow user to manage multiple budgets
- [ ] Must use app daily (Node on iOS possible through ish-app/ish)
- [ ] Add TS, Redux, immer or ImmutableJS, tests (code kata)
- [ ] Fork project, hook up Firebase, migrate to mobile React Native app




Places we deal with store object:
1. reading file on app bootstrap
2. displaying budget on main() prompt
3. mutating store budget on insertNewCharge()
4. mutating store charges on insertNewCharge()
5. mutating store budget on editBudget()
